# BigQuery Dataform Ecommerce Pipeline

## Purpose
To find the ecommerce insights on inventory, orders and user online behavior, building a data transformation pipeline with Dataform.

## Data Warehouse Structure
You can figure out the data warehouse structure in this following diagram, which follows the recommendation of [dbt's official documents about data structure](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) wo distinguish the staging zone and data mart zone.

## Data Model and Lineage Overview
You can know more about ER (Entity and Relationship) model and pipeline flow of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which follows the recommendation of [dbt's offical documents about data modeling technique](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/modular-data-modeling-technique)
